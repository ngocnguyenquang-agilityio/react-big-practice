## Tech Stacks

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of your application
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started): SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started): Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/): The testing library family of packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): Enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL
